# How to Ask Questions: The Ticket System

In this project, we follow a protocol that is widely used in industry and open-source communities. We do not use instant messaging or verbal questions for technical issues. Instead, we use a Ticket System (Github Issues).

## Motivation: Why do we need this?

We are not doing this to make your life difficult. We do this to help you become a better learner. 

1. Writing help us think because it helps with cognitive reconstruction. Writing down a problem forces us to organize our thoughts. Logic becomes clearer when we write it. e.g., when I decided to write down the problem clearly to ask my colleage, I often solved it myself halfway.
   - Goal: We want you to build **agency** (the ability to solve problems independently), not just follow instructions.
2. Building a knowledge base. Chats disappear, written words stay. By using tickets, we build a library of solutions together. FAQs will emerge from the ticket pools. You might notice that your question is already solved by reading old tickets.

## The 15-minute Rule

In the ticket template we provide, one pre-checked question is asking whether you have already spent 15 minutes on the questions without interruption.
- The science is our brain needs a little bit of struggle to trigger learning (Neuroplasticity). Without the short period of effort, you will be lessly likely to learn the concept better.
- The **Limit**: If you are still stuck after 30 minutes, **STOP**! Do not waste hours, you should open the Github Issue and start writing the ticket.

## Collaboration over Competition

We want to be clear about the culture of this project: We promote collaboration, not competition. Bonus points is performance-based, not rank-based, so you are not competing against your classmates. As mentioned in class, I don't mind if everyone gets full points. If everyone builds a great model, everyone gets the bonus.

Why collaborate?
- Teaching is learning: the best way to learn is to explain it to someone else. When you help a colleague debug/solve a question, you deepen your own understanding.
- Breaking "Tunnel Vision": when you debug for too long, your brain gets locked into one way of thinking. You might be staring at the same mistake but can't see it. A colleague brings a fresh pair of eyes and a different mental model. 
- Real-world engineering/research: Great software/research is built by teams who share knowledge, not by individuals who hide it.

Therefore, the Ticket Template includes a mandatory pre-checked question, asking if you have already discussed this problem with a colleague, and you need to provide 
1. who you talked to (Names)
2. What conclusions you reached (specifically, which solutions did you rule out together?)

## Submission Guidelines

Once you have passed the 15-minute rule, please submit a ticket using the provided template:

[Ticket template](examples/ticket_example.md).

Fill the template and submit it to Github Issues, then you will see a QA ticket as followed:

[Ticket](https://github.tik.uni-stuttgart.de/yixuan/Intro2DL-Project/issues/1)

Rules:
1. Use the template: Tickets that do not follow the template will be closed.
2. Be clear: use concise words, don't turn it into an essay. Less is better.
