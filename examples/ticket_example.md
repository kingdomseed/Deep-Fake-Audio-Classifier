#  Problem Summary 
[Describe the problem clearly in one sentence]
- Related module: [e.g., data preprocess, model architecture, evaluation]
- Main issue: [e.g., length mismatch; gradient explosion; NaN EER]

# Current vs. Expected Behaviour
Describe facts only. Do not add assumptions or use vague words like "seems" or "maybe".
- Expected behaviour: [what the code or model should produce in theory]
- Observed behaviour: [what actually happens, e.g., error messages, wrong outputs]
- Reproducible setup or code: [code should be already prepared, no live coding when asking the question in person.]

# Three Failed Attempts 
List three different attempts you already made. This shows you tried to solve the problem seriously.

For each attempt, include:

Attempt id
- Hypothesis: what you thought was wrong
- Action: what you changed or tested
- Result: what happened

Example:

Attempt 1
- Hypothesis: learning rate is too high
- Action: reduced LR from 1e-2 to 1e-3
- Result: still got NaN in loss

# Required Pre-checks

- [ ] 15-minute rule: I spent at least 15 minutes thinking and debugging without interruption, instead of stopping at the first error.

- [ ] external search: I checked official doc, googled results or other online services.
   - Most relevant results: [provide the link or the text]
   
- [ ] peer discussion: I discussed this with at least one classmate [Name: ___]
   - What possibilities we ruled out:
